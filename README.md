# ðŸ§± Stack Data Structure in C

This repository contains a simple and efficient **Stack** implementation in the **C programming language** using dynamic memory allocation.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Stack implemented using dynamic array (`malloc`)
- Basic operations:
  - `push` â€“ Add element to stack
  - `pop` â€“ Remove top element
  - `peek` â€“ View top element without removing it
- Safety checks for **overflow** and **underflow**
- Memory cleanup with `destroyStack()`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### âœ… Prerequisites

You'll need a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) installed on your system.

### ðŸ”§ Compilation

```bash
gcc stack -o stack.c
./stack
